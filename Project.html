                    &#160 &#160 &#160 In the past two years, I've done three innovative projects that showcase my 
                    expertise in software development, compiler design, and game development. 
                    The Random Lifestyle Generator offers users a customizable solution to inject 
                    spontaneity into their daily routines through a user-friendly Java GUI interface. 
                    The Compiler Individual Project demonstrates my ability to translate human-readable 
                    language into machine code efficiently using ALGOL C language, incorporating 
                    sophisticated symbol table functionality for informed decision-making. Finally, 
                    the Objective-Oriented Programming Individual Project introduces the Battle Bots Game, 
                    an immersive virtual arena where autonomous characters engage in intense combat, 
                    highlighting my proficiency in artificial intelligence and user interface design.

                            into machine code using ALGOL C language, leveraging Lex and YACC generators. By parsing user 
                            inputs and adhering to predefined rules within lex and YACC files, the compiler efficiently generates 
                            machine code. Furthermore, the incorporation of a symbol table enables meticulous tracking of 
                            existing expressions and variables, facilitating informed decisions regarding the availability of
