                    &#160 &#160 &#160 I enjoy a range of hobbies, but playing musical instruments is my favorite. 
                    I can play guitar, piano, ukulele, and kalimba. Whenever I have some free 
                    time, I like to cover songs and even write my own. Mixing different instruments 
                    together to create a nice accompaniment is something I really enjoy. It helps 
                    me unwind and release stress after a long day at work. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    &#160 &#160 &#160 Here are some songs that I covered. The first one, Song of the Lonely Mountain, is the 
                    theme song of movie The Hobbit, which is one of my favorite series of movie. I used guitar,
                    piano, drump, and kalimba to make this song about 4 to 5 years ago. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    &#160 &#160 &#160 The second song is a Chinese song called Hua Hai, 
                    which means the Flower Sea in English. The singer is Jay Chou, who is one of the most popular
                    singer in China. I covered this song recently, with piano and guitar mainly, plus a little bit of chorus.

            &#160 &#160 &#160 Out of all these instruments, the guitar holds a special place in my heart. 
            With the guitar, I have the freedom to sing along while playing, focus solely on the melody, 
            or experiment with crafting songs using various chords. I embarked on my guitar journey 
            independently around four years ago. Throughout these years, I've devoted countless hours 
            to playing, almost every day, without ever feeling weary. Whenever I feel stressed or anxious 
            due to school, the guitar serves as a reliable source of solace, effectively calming my mind.

            &#160 &#160 &#160 These two links provided below are the songs that I covered by pure guitar. 
            The first one is called Joker and the Queen. It is a really slow and relaxing song with simple 
            guitar accompanimentã€‚
        </p>

        <p>
            &#160 &#160 &#160 The second song was covered by me and my cousin, she was playing piano and I was
            playing guitar. The singer is Jay Chou, and the song's name is Shan Hu Hai, meaning th Chorals Sea. 
            It is a very beautiful song.
