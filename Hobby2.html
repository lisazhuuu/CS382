                <p> &#160 &#160 &#160 I possess proficiency in various sports, with tennis being 
                    my favorite. My parents' fervor for tennis influenced me from a young age, 
                    leading me to begin playing when I was little. From the age of 10, I dedicated 
                    at least an hour daily to tennis practice. By the time I turned 14, I commenced 
                    traveling extensively for training and competitions. This particular photo was 
                    captured in Illkley, Scotland, in 2017, affording me the opportunity to experience 
                    playing on a grass court for the first time. To date, it remains my sole encounter 
                    with such a surface.

                    &#160 &#160 &#160 Right now, I am a member of the NMSU Women's Tennis Team, 
                    which I find highly enjoyable. Our team dedicates three hours to practice
                    every day from Monday to Saturday, and during the spring semester, we engage 
                    in numerous matches. Almost weekly, we embark on travels to compete against 
                    other schools.
